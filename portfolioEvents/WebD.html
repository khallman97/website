		<h1>Website Design</h1>
		<p>		I have never done anything with html let alone web development. I wanted to make a goal to have my own personal website. I started off by watching some YouTube videos and getting a super basic idea of html. Although it was long, I used this YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3UH2gAhwPI, to help me get the basics down. From they I set out to learn how to make a personally website. I started off by googling how to make your own website. There were a lot of guides on how to do it with word press or other online tools. I wanted to make it a goal to do it all in html so that I could learn a new coding language. I used this small video series, http://bit.ly/2hCRv0P, to get an idea of what resources could be used. I discovered there are a lot of resources that are out there that help make your website look better. After I got a base for this website, which was just the home page and the concept of linking the other pages with the tabs, I then tried to acquire a domain. With some more research on the best way to do it, I purchased my domain and began to learn how to use cPanel. It turns out it was a lot easier to do then I thought and within a really short time I was able to upload my code and have my own personal website.

		<p>After all was said and done I learned a lot about html and css for that. I want to expand more on this and begin to learn javascript and php to better my website and learn more for the future.
