		<h3>Software Engineering - York University</h5>
		<p>I have always had a passion for design. When I was a kid I always wanted to be an architect, but not just any plain old
			architect. No, my idea of architecture was to design rocket ships and cars. Eventually I grew out of that but my passion
			for design remained.
		<br><br> 
			In my first year of high school I was introduced to the world of computers. I had to do a project where we had to build a computer that we thought we suit our needs. I was so attached to this project I dropped all my other homework and just focused on it. I ended up researching so much into computers and had opened a whole new world. When I handed in that project I ended up getting perfect and an attachment to computers that I would have never thought I would have.
		 <br><br> 
		 	I ended up building my own computer that summer and helped some of my friends build theirs too. I became the guy to go to at my school if you had a computer problem. Eventually I was introduced to programming and from that point I knew this was what I wanted to do with my life. So, I pursued it and ended up in software engineering where I am doing what I am passionate about and constantly learning day after day.
